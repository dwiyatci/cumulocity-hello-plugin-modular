A boilerplate to start writing Cumulocity UI plugin with a taste of [modular](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#folders-by-feature-structure) structure.

### Why?
This boilerplate is basically a twin of [cumulocity-ui-plugin-examples](https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-ui-plugin-examples) and a sibling to [cumulocity-smart-apps-webpack](https://github.com/dwiyatci/cumulocity-smart-apps-webpack): it exists for similar reasons. ;)

## Installation
* Make sure you have Node.js â‰¥ v6.9.0 installed and npm from its [website](https://nodejs.org), or better even, use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

* Clone the repo, `cd` to your project directory, and setup dependencies:

```bash
$ npm run install:clean
```

## Usage
Check out [the introduction to plugin development docs](http://cumulocity.com/guides/web/introduction/).

## Quicky up and running
Oh well, I know that you guys are a bunch of lazy people. How to get this app deployed and see it running on my tenant, you ask? Be my guest:

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

After a few more steps in interactive command line user interfaces, you should then be able to access the app on `https://<your-tenant-url>/apps/helloapp`.

## Unit testing
```bash
$ npm t
```

~~Note that you may need to supply different app context path other than `helloapp` in npm scripts for `test` (in `package.json`) if you want to reuse this boilerplate.~~

## Linting
```bash
$ npm run lint <targetFileOrDir>
```

Example:
```bash
$ npm run lint plugins
```

Or better yet, make your IDE automatically integrate the linting process based on the .rc file (`.eslintrc.yaml`).

The rules quite strictly follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide (ES5)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5).
